Back story:

My classmate, Aoife, submitted her dissertation a week before mine. My
friend Jenny, the XO, took her dissertation, got her to sign some forms,
then looked up at her. Aoife looked back, expectantly.

Jenny: "what, do expect fireworks?"
Aoife: "yeah, kind of"
Jenny: "sorry, you're done, the rest is up to you"

Fast forward one week, I handed Jenny my dissertation, signed the forms, and
collapsed on her desk. When I looked up, she had this bottle of prosecco
waiting for me.

Obviously, I sent a picture to Aoife, because I'm mildly evil.
